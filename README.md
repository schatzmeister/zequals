# zequals
Use a computer for estimations, not calculations.

Inspired by a [Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOJOfh2_4PE), this library provides the `zequals` operation and a data type to go along with that. The operation is basically ruthless rounding to one significant place which is totally sufficient in many cases; with modern computers we can get a very high precision, but that doesnâ€™t really help if accuracy is so low that basically none of the digits can be trusted. Zequals embraces the philosophy of *good enough*.
